# To do app
create a list of to items allow for delete and tagging as well as search

All that is needed is to pull the repo locally and as long as you have npm installed already then... 

STEP 1. run "npm install"

STEP 2. run "json-server db.json"

Fist step is to create the directory for the node_module dependencies.  I have added more dependancies than I used because I anticipate flushing this page out.
Second step is to set up fake db

If you want to use live-server...
run npm start


Functionally testing ongoing on IE Chrome and safari ipad and iphone

Functionally it is not fully working yet it is still being built.  List of missing features:

1. Search not functioning.

2. Drop down menu not working from top nav.

3. Validation for Add Item modal.

4. Upload image is not adding image ref to json.db.
