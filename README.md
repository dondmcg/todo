# etsyapi
get a list of products from the etsy api

All that is needed is to pull the repo locally and as long as you have npm installed already then... 
run "npm install"
to create the directory for the node_module dependencies.  I have added more dependancies than I used because I anticipate flushing this page out.

If you want to use live-server...
run npm start

Hosted version http://www.mcgrathdesigns.com/etsylist

I have added a couple of sample QUnit tests.

Functionally tested on IE Chrome and safari ipad and iphone

To see sample tests go to:

Nice To Have:

1. change filters in header nav to dropdown lists (possibly add them to search bar or left nav as optional search params)
